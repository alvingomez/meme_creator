In creating this project, the following tools will be use:
1. I'll be using a CSS3 flexbox. A new way to create responsive layouts on the web.
2. Using the Webpack module bundler to convert all  dependencies and code to static assets.
3. Using HTML5 canvas for drawing graphics on the fly with JavaScript.

Creating a solid production build that is fully optimized, minified, and versioned.
